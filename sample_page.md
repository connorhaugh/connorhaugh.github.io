**SafeRide:** SafeRide is an ongoing project to make a one-page React app for an existing ridesharing service on Amherst's campus. Due to network security concerns entirely unrelated to SafeRide, the Amherst IT department requires that SafeRide cannot be open-source. This, however, will attempt to demonstrate the app.

### 1. The Problem: A SafeRide Home, without the hassle
 
SafeRide is an existing service which operates at Amherst every evening, which allows for a safe ride between any two amherst buildings after dark. In the previous system, community members had to call the police dispatcher to request a saferide. That raised questions about how effective the service might possibly be, as the transparency of the service, where students drive the vehicles was in jeapordy. This problem birthed saferide.


### 2. The project began with the design of a lean, single-page app.

I had just finished a CodeCademy course on react, and was excited to try to develop a prototype. Expo was the logical enviroment to develop such an app, as it allows for the development of IOS and Android compatable apps with React.

### 3. It then required a back-end
